# TMC4671-LearningNote
***
## Prewritten
  The purpose of this project is to record my learning steppes of TMC4671 in case I forgot one day. If this project gives someone with the same confusion on that chip some little help, I will be happy.

## What is TMC4671 and what can it do?
  TMC4671 is a fully `integrated servo controller` that provides Field Oriented Control for BLDC/PMSM and 2-phase Stepper Motors as well as DC motors and voice coils.
  That is the Official introduction of the datasheet.
  It can drive all motors under this line.
